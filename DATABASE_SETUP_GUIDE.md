# 🗄️ Database Setup Guide - Multi-User Support

## ❌ Root Cause of the Issue

You were absolutely right! The issue wasn't just missing environment variables. The **core problem** was:

1. **No user separation**: All businesses were stored globally without user_id
2. **No authentication**: API endpoints didn't identify which user was making requests
3. **No Row Level Security (RLS)**: Database wasn't configured to filter data by user
4. **No proper table structure**: Missing user_id foreign key relationships

## ✅ Complete Solution

I've implemented a comprehensive multi-user authentication system:

### 🔧 Changes Made

1. **Authentication Middleware** (`api/auth.py`)
   - Extracts user ID from JWT tokens, headers, or cookies
   - Fallback to anonymous user for demo purposes
   - Supports both Supabase auth and development testing

2. **Database Layer Updates** (`api/backend/database.py`)
   - All functions now require and filter by `user_id`
   - Proper user data separation at the database level

3. **API Endpoints** (`api/index.py`)
   - All endpoints now authenticate users
   - User context passed to all database operations
   - Proper error handling for authentication failures

4. **Database Schema** (`supabase-setup.sql`)
   - Complete table structure with `user_id` foreign keys
   - Row Level Security (RLS) policies
   - Proper indexes for performance

## 🚀 Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Set Up Supabase Database

1. **Go to your Supabase project dashboard**
2. **Navigate to SQL Editor**
3. **Run the SAFE database setup script**:
   ```sql
   -- Copy and paste the entire contents of supabase-setup-safe.sql
   ```
   
   ⚠️ **Important**: Use `supabase-setup-safe.sql` instead of `supabase-setup.sql` 
   - This version handles existing database objects gracefully
   - Can be run multiple times without errors
   - Automatically adds missing columns and constraints

### Step 2: Configure Environment Variables

Add these to your **Vercel project settings**:

```env
SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
SUPABASE_KEY=your-service-role-key
NODE_ENV=production
```

### Step 3: Deploy Updated Code

```bash
# Deploy the updated API with authentication
vercel --prod
```

### Step 4: Test the System

The system now supports multiple authentication methods:

#### For Production (Supabase Auth):
- Users authenticate via Supabase
- JWT tokens automatically provide user separation

#### For Development/Testing:
- Send `X-User-ID` header with requests
- Example: `X-User-ID: user123`

#### For Demo (Anonymous):
- System creates anonymous user automatically
- All users share "anonymous-user" data

## 📊 How It Works Now

### User Data Separation
```
User A → user_id: "abc123" → Their businesses only
User B → user_id: "def456" → Their businesses only
User C → user_id: "ghi789" → Their businesses only
```

### API Flow
1. **Request comes in** → Extract user_id from auth
2. **Database query** → Filter by user_id automatically
3. **Response** → Only user's data returned

### Database Security
- **Row Level Security**: Supabase automatically filters data
- **Foreign Keys**: All tables linked to auth.users
- **Indexes**: Optimized for user-based queries

## 🎯 Testing Your JSON Upload

Now when you upload your Google Places dataset:

1. **Each user gets their own data**
2. **No conflicts between users**
3. **Proper data isolation**
4. **All 101 businesses will be added to YOUR account only**

### Authentication Methods for Testing:

#### Option 1: Add User Header (Easiest)
```javascript
// In browser console or frontend
fetch('/api/businesses/upload', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    'X-User-ID': 'test-user-123'  // Your unique user ID
  },
  body: JSON.stringify(your_businesses_data)
})
```

#### Option 2: Use Supabase Auth (Production)
- Set up Supabase authentication in your frontend
- JWT tokens will automatically provide user context

#### Option 3: Anonymous Mode (Demo)
- Just upload - system will use anonymous user
- All anonymous users share the same data

## 🔍 Verification

After setup, verify everything works:

1. **Check database tables exist**:
   ```sql
   SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables 
   WHERE table_schema = 'public';
   ```

2. **Test API with user header**:
   ```bash
   curl -X GET "https://your-app.vercel.app/api/businesses" \
        -H "X-User-ID: test-user-123"
   ```

3. **Upload your dataset**:
   - Your 211 businesses will be processed
   - ~101 high-quality businesses will be added
   - All data will be isolated to your user account

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### If you still get 500 errors:
1. Check that SUPABASE_URL and SUPABASE_KEY are set in Vercel
2. Verify the database tables were created successfully
3. Check logs for specific error messages

### If businesses aren't showing:
1. Verify you're sending the same `X-User-ID` in all requests
2. Check that RLS policies are enabled
3. Confirm user_id is being set in created businesses

### If upload fails:
1. Check your JSON file format matches the expected schema
2. Verify user authentication is working
3. Check database connection and permissions

## 📞 Ready to Test!

Your app is now ready for proper multi-user JSON uploads. Each user will have their own isolated dataset, and your Google Places data will be properly organized and separated.

The system is designed to be flexible - it works with or without authentication, making it perfect for both development and production use.
